# Dubhe Client SDK

Dubhe is client agnostic: any client -- a browser, a game engine, or an ios/android app -- can implement the synchronization protocol and a client-side cache to replicate Store tables, along with the necessary infrastructure to send transactions to the World.

Currently we only support browsers, Node and the Alkaid Engine.

## Getting Started

Before proceeding with the next steps, make sure you have deployed your own world contract via cli.

When the world contract is deployed successfully, it will return a PackageId (the contract's ObjectId) and a WorldId (the World Store's ObjectId).

It comes with

- [sui-client](/dubhe/sui-client) The sui-client is used for building and developing a Sui project.
- [aptos-client](/dubhe/aptos-client) The aptos-client is used for building and developing a Aptos project.
- [rooch-client](/dubhe/rooch-client) The rooch-client is used for building and developing a Rooch project.
- [initia-client](/dubhe/initia-client) The initia-client is used for building and developing a Initial project.
- [movement-client](/dubhe/movement-client) The movement-client is used for building and developing a Movement project.
- [phad-client](/dubhe/phad-client) The phad-client is used for building and developing a Phad project.
