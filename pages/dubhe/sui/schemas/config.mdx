## Schemas Config & `schemagen` Tool

The `schemagen` CLI tool generates libraries for Schemas. It makes it much less error-prone than using the Schemas low-level API, and comes with typed Move APIs when setting and retrieving records.

### Using `schemagen` with the Dubhe framework

If you are using the Dubhe framework and have a `dubhe.config.ts` file in your project, you can edit your Schemas config directly in this file!

A Schemas config should be named `dubhe.config.ts`, and placed at the root of your project.

This is the minimal config:

```tsx
import { DubheConfig } from '@0xobelisk/sui-common';

export const dubheConfig = {
  name: "example", // name of the Move project
  description: "example desc", // description of the Move project
  schemas: {}, // an empty config with no schemasï¼Œ
} as DubheConfig;
```

### Generating the schemas

To generate the schemas, run `pnpm dubhe schemagen` in the same folder as the config file.

### Schema Data

Currently, Schema supports all the basic types of Move, and will be added later according to the demand.

```tsx
export const dubheConfig = {
  name: "example",
  description: "example desc",
  data: {
      Student: {
          name: "string",
          age: "u8",
      },
  },
  schemas: {},
} as DubheConfig;
```
### Storages

Schema currently supports three storage structures, StorageValue, StorageMap, StorageDoubleMap.

```tsx
import { DubheConfig, storage } from "@0xobelisk/sui-common";
export const dubheConfig = {
  name: "example",
  description: "example desc",
  data: {
      Student: {
          name: "string",
          age: "u8",
      },
  },
  schemas: {
     class: storage('u8'),
     student: storage('address', 'Student'),
     teacher: storage('address', 'u8', 'address'),
  },
} as DubheConfig;
```

### Events

```tsx
import { DubheConfig, storage } from "@0xobelisk/sui-common";
export const dubheConfig = {
  name: "example",
  description: "example desc",
  data: {
      Student: {
          name: "string",
          age: "u8",
      },
  },
  schemas: {
     class: storage('u8'),
     student: storage('address', 'Student'),
     teacher: storage('address', 'u8', 'address'),
  },
  events: {
     student_added : {
        address: "address",
        info: "Student",
    },
    student_removed: {
         address: "u32",
    },
 }
} as DubheConfig;
```

### Errors
```tsx
import { DubheConfig, storage } from "@0xobelisk/sui-common";
export const dubheConfig = {
  name: "example",
  description: "example desc",
  data: {
      Student: {
          name: "string",
          age: "u8",
      },
  },
  schemas: {
     class: storage('u8'),
     student: storage('address', 'Student'),
     teacher: storage('address', 'u8', 'address'),
  },
  events: {
     student_added : {
        address: "address",
        info: "Student",
    },
    student_removed: {
         address: "u32",
    },
 },
  errors: {
    student_not_found: "Student not found",
    student_already_exists: "Student already exists",
    },
} as DubheConfig;
```
