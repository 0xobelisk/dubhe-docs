# Use dubhe to develop a contract

Let's develop one of the simplest examples, called Distributed Messaging, or dms for short. The contract will have a schema called message, which will have a field called content, which will store the message content. The contract will have a method called send, which will take a string as a parameter and store it in the content field of the mailbox schema. The contract will also have an event called MessageSent, which will be triggered when a message is sent.

Dubhe generates some code based on the dubhe.config.ts configuration, so we just need to focus on this file.

```ts
import { DubheConfig } from "@0xobelisk/sui-common";
export const dubheConfig = {
  name: "template",
  description: "template",
  schemas: {},
} as DubheConfig;
```

Let's go over what's in dubheConfig

- name: The name of the contract project.
- description: The description of the contract project.
- schemas: The schema of the contract project. Refer to the Schemas section for details of schema.

To complete dms contract I need a Schema to store the numbers, now let's complete the Schema.

```ts filename="dubhe.config.ts" {5-7} copy showLineNumbers
import { DubheConfig, storage } from "@0xobelisk/sui-common";
export const dubheConfig = {
  name: "dms",
  description: "Distributed Messaging",
  schemas: {
    message: storage('String'),
  },
} as DubheConfig;
```

The name of this Schema is message, and he has only one number field with storage type `StorageValue`, which is used to store `String`.

Now we need to generate the contract frame content using Dubhe's most powerful feature.

```bash
âžœ  pnpm dubhe schemagen

ðŸš€ Starting Schema Generation Process...
ðŸ“‹ Project Configuration:
     â””â”€ Name: dms
     â””â”€ Description: Distributed Messaging
     â””â”€ Network: testnet

ðŸ”¨ Starting Schema Structure Generation...
     â””â”€ message: StorageValue<String>

âœ…  Schema Generation Process Complete!
```

Take a look at the file structure of dms, we don't need to concern ourselves with anything else but our business code systems folder.

```bash
â”œâ”€â”€ Move.toml
â””â”€â”€ sources
    â”œâ”€â”€ codegen
    â”‚         â”œâ”€â”€ dapp
    â”‚         â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ metadata.move
    â”‚         â”‚    â”œâ”€â”€ schema.move
    â”‚         â”‚    â””â”€â”€ system.move
    â”‚         â”œâ”€â”€ genesis.move
    â”‚         â””â”€â”€ schema.move
    â”œâ”€â”€ scripts
    â”‚         â”œâ”€â”€ deploy_hook.move
    â”‚         â””â”€â”€ migrate.move
    â”œâ”€â”€ systems
    â””â”€â”€ tests
        â””â”€â”€ init.move

7 directories, 9 files

```

A Message Schema has been generated for you, now you need to write your own business code!
We create a new move file called message in the Systems folder.

```bash
touch contracts/counter/sources/systems/message.move
```

This can be easily achieved with the help of Dubhe's code generation. The contents of the file:

```move filename="message.move"
module dms::message_system {
    use std::ascii::String;
    use dms::dms_schema::Schema;

    public entry fun send(schema: &mut Schema, content: String) {
        schema.message().set(content);
    }
}
```

Let's add an error handler so that the length of the content doesn't exceed 12, how to do error handling?

```ts filename="dubhe.config.ts" {8-10} copy showLineNumbers
import { DubheConfig, storage } from "@0xobelisk/sui-common";
export const dubheConfig = {
  name: "dms",
  description: "Distributed Messaging",
  schemas: {
    message: storage('String'),
  },
  errors: {
    invalid_content_length: "Content length must be less than 12",
  },
} as DubheConfig;
```

The error handling code has been added, now we also want to add events to the contract to tell us who sent what message.

```ts filename="dubhe.config.ts" {11-16} copy showLineNumbers
import { DubheConfig } from "@0xobelisk/sui-common";
export const dubheConfig = {
  name: "dms",
  description: "Distributed Messaging",
  schemas: {
    message: "StorageValue<String>",
  },
  errors: {
    invalid_content_length: "Content length must be less than 12",
  },
  events: {
    message_sent: {
      sender: "address",
      content: "String",
    },
  },
} as DubheConfig;
```

Execute the schemagen command here.

```bash
âžœ  dubhe-template-project pnpm dubhe schemagen

ðŸš€ Starting Schema Generation Process...
ðŸ“‹ Project Configuration:
     â””â”€ Name: dms
     â””â”€ Description: Distributed Messaging
     â””â”€ Network: testnet

ðŸ“¦ Starting Schema Event Generation...
     â””â”€ message_sent event: {"sender":"address","content":"String"}

ðŸ”¨ Starting Schema Structure Generation...
     â””â”€ message: StorageValue<String>

ðŸ“¦ Starting Schema Error Generation...
     â””â”€ invalid_content_length: Content length must be less than 12

âœ…  Schema Generation Process Complete!
```

Errors and events are already generated.

First we do an error check, the input content must be greater than 0.

```move filename="message.move" {4, 7} copy showLineNumbers
module dms::message_system {
    use std::ascii::String;
    use dms::dms_schema::Schema;
    use dms::dms_errors::invalid_content_length_error;

    public entry fun send(schema: &mut Schema, content: String) {
        invalid_content_length_error(content.length() < 12);
        schema.message().set(content);
    }
}
```

Finally we add events to the contract.

```move filename="message.move" {5, 10} copy showLineNumbers
module dms::message_system {
    use std::ascii::String;
    use dms::dms_schema::Schema;
    use dms::dms_errors::invalid_content_length_error;
    use dms::dms_events::message_sent_event;

    public entry fun send(schema: &mut Schema, content: String, ctx: &mut TxContext) {
        invalid_content_length_error(content.length() < 12);
        schema.message().set(content);
        message_sent_event(ctx.sender(), content);
    }
}
```

By this point we need to write the contents of the deploy_hook, which will be automatically executed for you when the contract is deployed, now we initialise the content in the store to `Hello World!`.

```bash
dubhe-template-project/contracts/counter/sources/scripts/deploy_hook.move
```

```move filename="deploy_hook.move" {12} copy showLineNumbers
  // Copyright (c) Obelisk Labs, Inc.
  // SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
  #[allow(unused_use)]

  /* Autogenerated file. Do not edit manually. */

  module dms::deploy_hook {
  use std::ascii::string;
  use dms::dms_schema::Schema;

  public(package) fun run(_schema: &mut Schema, _ctx: &mut TxContext) {
        _schema.message().set(string(b"Hello World!"));
  }
}

```

Let's run the Build command to check for syntax errors.

```bash
âžœ  pnpm dubhe build --network localnet
