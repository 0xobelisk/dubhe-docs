# Technology Deep-Dive

## Technology Deep-Dive

### Overview

Dubhe consists of three core components:

1. **Dubhe Engine** — Real-time ECS contract framework powered by Move VM
2. **Dubhe Channel** — Millisecond session channel with batch state sync to base chain
3. **Dubhe OS** — Governance and coordination layer built with Polkadot SDK

> In one line: Dubhe = Unreal/Unity × Firebase for Web3 — TPS, latency, and dev experience match Web2 games and apps.

### Layered Architecture

The architecture consists of multiple layers working together:

- **Front-end DApps** (React/Unity) - User interface layer
- **Dubhe SDK** (TypeScript/Rust) - Development tools
- **Dubhe Channel** - High-performance session layer
- **Dubhe Engine** - Core Move VM runtime
- **DubheOS L1** - Base consensus and governance layer

### Performance Benchmarks

Based on Testnet-3 results from May 2025:

| Metric                  | Current Result | 2026 Target       | Notes                |
| ----------------------- | -------------- | ----------------- | -------------------- |
| Channel TPS (per shard) | 50,000         | 500,000           | 4H8G5M instance      |
| User Perceived Latency  | Under 50ms     | Under 20ms        | Tick interval        |
| Mainchain Finality      | 3 seconds      | 2 seconds or less | Commit and confirm   |
| Cost per Set Operation  | $0.005         | $0.0001           | Target fee reduction |

### Key Innovations

| Area                  | Legacy Pain Points                            | Dubhe Innovation                                    |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Real-time Interaction | EVM 12s blocks create 1s+ latency             | Millisecond Channel with async finality             |
| Developer Experience  | Low-code SDKs lack infrastructure abstraction | Engine ECS with codegen for auto DB and indexer     |
| Scalability           | TPS decreases with more nodes                 | Session-Sharding with parallel Channels             |
| Economic Model        | Gas fees only, no builder incentives          | Set pricing with burn mechanism and builder rewards |
| Governance            | Multisig/Snapshot not binding                 | Native OpenGov timelock with automatic execution    |
