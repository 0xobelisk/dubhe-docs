# Token Economics

## Token Economy

### Overview

Dubhe adopts a **dual-mechanism** of programmable fees and burn: DUBHE is charged per interaction and a portion of revenue is burned to maintain scarcity and network security.

### Design Principles

| Principle                    | Description                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Contribution-Based**       | Allocation, inflation, and rewards are distributed based on on-chain contributions from projects, nodes, and users |
| **Elastic Structure**        | Key metrics (inflation, fee caps) are on-chain parameterized via governance for market and regulatory adaptability |
| **Sustainable Growth**       | Combines fee burn with ecological reinvestment for long-term deflationary expectations                             |
| **Simple & Transparent**     | All models and spending are on-chain and publicly auditable                                                        |
| **Data-Driven Optimization** | Metrics inform governance proposals to iteratively improve parameters                                              |

### DUBHE Token Utilities

- **Set Fees**: Users writing data on Dubhe Engine-based apps pay $DUBHE per `set()` operation.
- **Collateral**: Dubhe Channel requires deposits for fraud-proof guarantees and data relay service.
- **Staking Security**: Token holders can delegate DUBHE to DubheOS nodes and earn block validation rewards.
- **Governance Voting**: Token holders vote on upgrades, treasury, and parameter changes via DubheOS.

- **Strategic Investment**: In collaboration with Obelisk Mesh.

### Dubhe Infrastructure Fund (DIF)

### 60-Month Unlock Curve Highlights:

- **TGE Initial Circulating**: ≈ 7% (Launchpad + DEX + Gas LP)
- **12m**: ~22% (Labs & team cliffs begin)
- **24m**: Linear unlock continues → ~42%
- **36m**: Seed/A rounds + community incentives completed → ~60%
- **48m**: Foundation, strategic pool mostly unlocked → ~75%
- **60m**: Final unlocks → **≈ 76%**, pending DAO trigger for Ecosystem/Reserves

> **Note**: The token distribution follows a carefully designed 60-month vesting schedule to ensure long-term alignment and prevent market dumping. Visual representations of the unlock curve and distribution breakdown are referenced in the original documentation with accompanying charts.
