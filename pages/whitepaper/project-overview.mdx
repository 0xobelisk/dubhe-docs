## Introduction

### Our Origin

**Dubhe** originated in 2023 as an internal incubation project of Obelisk Labs, initially known as _Obelisk Engine_. It became independent in 2025. Dubhe now focuses on the **Move Virtual Machine (MVM)** ecosystem, providing a three-layer architecture: **Engine – OS – Channel**, designed to make real-time Web3 apps (DeFi, on-chain games, social) as seamless as Web2.

### Mission

> To empower creators and businesses to build and create value freely in the decentralized world through composable, high-performance on-chain infrastructure.

### Vision

- Dubhe aims to become the **default session layer for real-time global Web3 applications**, serving millions of developers and hundreds of millions of end-users.
- Through modular technology and simplified developer experience, Dubhe seeks to expand the Move ecosystem to multi-chain and multi-rollup environments, covering **over 50%** of on-chain interaction volume within five years.

### Value Proposition

1. **Unified Developer Experience** — Dubhe Engine allows multi-chain deployment from a single declarative schema via code generation.
2. **Extreme Performance** — Dubhe Channel enables sub-50 ms execution and **>500,000 TPS** through rapid validation and state sync.
3. **Sustainable Economy** — Charges based on `set()` calls, paid in DUBHE; cost scales linearly with business growth.
4. **Initial User Base** — With flagship app Merak, Dubhe already supports >200k on-chain active addresses and >20M+ `set()` operations.
